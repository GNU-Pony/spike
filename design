Spike is designed to be minimal to reduce the risk of bugs,
while supporting installation to another OS installation,
personally modify file ownerships (in case something is wrong),
nice package repository organisation, and support package
patches, as well as being secure.

Spikes security features includes secure removal of files,
using the program shred (opt-in, shredding takes time),
and uses git for integrity.

Spike runs on top of git to reduce the amount of code to
reduce code. Using git provides package integrity, and
simple bootstrapping.
