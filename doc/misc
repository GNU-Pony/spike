To freeze Spike from updating when running --bootstrap put a file named `frozen.spike` in the directory `.git` in your Spike directory.

Similarly, you can put .git/frozen.spike in a repository directory to freeze it.


To prevent errors when using public and private at the same time, public ID:s have the most significant bit turned off while the
private ID:s have the most significant bit turned on.


Database files, prepended by priv_ for private:

	 fileid_id	file id  → owner scroll id	value_size = DB_SIZE_ID = 4		(→ max installed pony count = 4294967296)
	 id_fileid      scroll id → owned file id	value_size = DB_SIZE_FILEID = 8		(→ max installed file count = 4294967296²)
	 fileid_file    file id → lb(file name lenght)	value_size = DB_SIZE_FILELEN = 1	(→ max file name length = 2²⁵⁶ bytes (cut to 2³²))
	 fileid_file¤   file id → file name 		value_size = 2↑¤
	 file_fileid    file name → file id             value_size = DB_SIZE_FILEID = 8
	 id_scroll	scroll id → scroll name		value_size = DB_SIZE_SCROLL = 64	(→ max scroll name length = 64 ASCII characters)
	 scroll_id	scroll name → scroll id		value_size = DB_SIZE_ID = 4
	 id_deps	scroll id → deps scrolls id	value_size = DB_SIZE_ID = 4		(with reflection for installed as explicit)
	 deps_id	deps scroll id → scrolls id	value_size = DB_SIZE_ID = 4		(with reflection for installed as explicit)
	 fileid_+	file id → (void)		value_size = 0		  		(claimed with --entire if listed)


An example shot of a package may be added by placing a PNG (yes, only PNG, we do not want any crappy formats) in the same directory
as the scroll and naming it identically to the scroll file except with `.png` at the end of the file name in addition to `.scroll`.
