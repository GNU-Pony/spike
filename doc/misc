To freeze Spike from updating when running --bootstrap put a file named `frozen.spike` in the directory `.git` in your Spike directory.

Similarly, you can put .git/frozen.spike in a repository directory to freeze it.


Database files, prepended by priv_ for private:

	 file_id	file → owner scroll id		value_size = DB_SIZE_ID = 4
	 id_fileid      scroll id → owned file id	value_size = DB_SIZE_FILEID = 64
	 fileid_file    file id → lb(file name lenght)	value_size = DB_SIZE_FILELEN = 4 (→ max file name lenght = 65536 bytes)
	 fileid_file¤   file id → file name 		value_size = 2↑¤
	 file_fileid    file name → file id             value_size = DB_SIZE_FILEID = 64
	 id_scroll	scroll id → scroll name		value_size = DB_SIZE_FILEID = 64
	 scroll_id	scroll name → scroll id		value_size = DB_SIZE_ID = 4
