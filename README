Spike is an awesome package manager, that uses git.

Because it uses git anypony can simply setup their own repositories,
and every user will have local copies of the repositories in case the
upstream gets corrupted or is offline. Additionally you users can ge
back in time in the package installations and package repositories,
and local changes can be done to the repositories that will be
preserved even when that part of the repository is updated.

Spike inheritally has integrity control, this however does not
been that a packages does not need signing, but git does support
GPG-signing and verification [Git 1.8.2-rc4].
