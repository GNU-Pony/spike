Spike is an awesome package manager, that uses git.

Because it uses git anypony can simply setup their own repositories, and
every user will have local copies of the repositories in case the upstream
gets corrupted or is offline. Additionally you users can ge back in time
in the package installations and package repositories, and local changes
can be done to the repositories that will be preserved even when that part
of the repository is updated.

Spike inheritally has integrity control, this however does not been that
a packages does not need signing, but git does support GPG-signing and
verification [Git 1.8.2-rc4].

Spike is designed to be minimal to reduce the risk of bugs, while
supporting installation to another OS installation, hive nice package
organisation, package patches, as well as being secure.

Spikes security features includes secure removal of files, using the
program shred (opt-in, shredding takes time), and uses git for integrity
with GPG-signatures checked by git for trust.

Spike supports state archiving to so system administrators can make one
installation and deploy it on multiple computers, as well as providing a
simple way to roll back incase a system update breaks the system.
